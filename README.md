# ðŸ“» Real-Time FM Receiver: SDR for Mono/Stereo Audio and RDS

This project implements a real-time software-defined radio (SDR) system capable of demodulating FM mono audio, stereo audio, and Radio Data System (RDS) signals using low-cost RF hardware and a Raspberry Pi 4.

The system processes 2.4 MS/s I/Q input streams and supports multiple modes with custom sample rates. Signal processing is implemented in Python for modeling and C++ for real-time execution, leveraging efficient filtering, resampling, multithreading, and Unix-style piping (`stdin/stdout`).

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Real-Time FM Demodulation** â€“ Mono, stereo, and RDS audio/data decoding.
- **DSP Optimization** â€“ Combined upsampling, filtering, and downsampling into a single resampler.
- **Stereo Carrier Recovery** â€“ Implemented digital PLL for 38 kHz subcarrier regeneration.
- **RDS Decoding** â€“ Extracted PI/PTY/PS fields using Manchester decoding and bit-wise parsing.
- **Multithreaded Architecture** â€“ Separate threads for RF frontend and audio output with safe queues.
- **Unix Piping** â€“ Designed as a streaming pipeline using `stdin`/`stdout` for block-wise processing.

### Python Modeling
Used the Python scripts (`fmMonoBlock.py`, `fmStereoBlock.py`, `fmRDS.py`) to prototype and visualize signal flow so that correctness can be verified before real-time implementation.

### Real-time implementation in C++
The real-time implementation of the project was done on a Rasberry-Pi 4 . The implementation switched between modes of mono audio and stereo audio using a Unix-pipelined style architecture.

```bash
python3 fmMonoBlock.py
python3 fmStereoBlock.py
python3 fmRDS.py
